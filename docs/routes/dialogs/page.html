                Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
                Latin
                literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                Hampden-Sydney
                College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage,
                and
                going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum
                comes
                from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by
                Cicero,
                written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The
                first
                line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
    
                The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections
                1.10.32
                and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
                accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
